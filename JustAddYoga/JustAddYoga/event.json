               "text": "We have made it our mission to combat the infamous Seattle Freeze and get people moving their bodies. We put our heads together and one day the light bulb went off. What better way to get people together then to combine two of our favorite things, Beer and Yoga! Now we are throwing in another favorite thing, hiking!!   We love getting out into the great outdoors and taking in all the beauty the PacNW has to offer. We hope you will join us for a hike to Snow Lake. The plan is to meet at the Park N Ride on Mercer Island and carpool to the trailhead. Following our hike we will grab our mats and meet at the base for an, all levels, Yoga practice. Once we are feeling all loosey goosey, we will head down to Dru Bru for a nice cold pint of your favorite beer. You will have the option to order lunch from Commonwealth (not included), before heading back to Seattle.   Details: 8am - Leave from the Mercer Island Park N Ride  9am- Begin the hike  12pm- Yoga Class (times may vary)  1pm - Head to Dru Bru   About the Hike - Snow Lake is a 7 mile round trip hike, this hike is ranked moderate, beautiful views of Snoqualamie valley and the largest of the Alpine Lakes make the sweat well worth it! For more information visit,  http://bit.ly/1Wcrnlu , \nAbout Dru Bru: Our beers are European-inspired and uniquely sessionable – designed to showcase deep flavors in an approachable package. Using unfiltered Snoqualmie Pass mountain water, imported German malts and Yakima Valley hops we craft beers that are distinctly Dru Bru.   FAQs   Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?  All ages are welcome    What should I bring?  A Yoga mat, water, trail snacks and an attitude of gratitude   Can I bring my dog to the event?  Yes! You will need to leave your pooch tied up during the Yoga class, but your well behaved, people and other dog friendly pooch is welcome to join on the hike and for beers after.

Washington growers produce 60% of the apples in the United States, and cider-specific varieties are in a major shortage, so we set out to put innovative spins on classic cider-making methods to bring out the best in the everyday apple. <BR></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN CLASS=\"_4n-j _3cht fsl\"><SPAN CLASS=\"_4n-j _3cht fsl\"><SPAN CLASS=\"text_exposed_show\">FAQs<BR> <BR> Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?<BR> <BR> Yes.
