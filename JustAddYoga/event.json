Washington growers produce 60% of the apples in the United States, and cider-specific varieties are in a major shortage, so we set out to put innovative spins on classic cider-making methods to bring out the best in the everyday apple. \nFAQs  Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?  Yes. You must be 21 to attend this event.  What should I bring?  A Yoga mat, water bottle and an attitude of gratitude  What time do doors open?  Doors open at 10 am, we advise arriving early to give you a chance to set up your mat and get to know those around you  Can I bring my children?  We love the little ones, but this is an adults only activity, children are welcome to join after class  What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?  Free parking available  Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?  cheers@justaddyogaevents.com  Is my ticket transferrable?  No, tickets are not transferrable  Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?  Nope. In fact, we encourage you to use your mobile ticket. Save the trees!   What is the refund policy?
